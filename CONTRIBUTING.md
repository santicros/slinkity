# Hey there fellow contributor üëã

Glad to see you here. We're open to contributions of all kinds, including:
- Improvements to our docs (new tutorials, phrasing, CSS styling, etc)
- Core bug fixes
- Core features and performance enhancements
- New Slinkity tutorials, example projects, and more

## Before diving into the code...

We ask that you follow this little pre-flight checklist:

1. **Have I checked the [community discord](https://discord.gg/AfZMRCg8) and [existing issue logs](https://github.com/slinkity/slinkity/issues) first?** We've built strong communication channels to help our userbase. Sparking a discussion on Discord or sharing in issues threads related to your problem is a great starting point!
2. **Have I reviewed [the existing documentation](https://slinkity.dev/docs/)?** You may find your problem or feature request already nestled in our existing featureset. And if you're contributing to the docs themselves, it's good to get a lay of the land first.
3. **Is my problem or feature request [documented as an issue](https://github.com/slinkity/slinkity/issues) before I start working?** We love to see pull requests that immediately resolve whatever issue you're having. But before you get to work, we ask that you grab one of our lovely issue templates to explain what you're looking to do. You can tag this issue in your PR later using the "Resolves #[issue-number]" description.

‚òùÔ∏è Got it? Good. Now let's talk crafting your first PR üòÅ

## Architecture of Slinkity Core

## Points to hit

1. [X] **Overview of issues, help forums, and other resources** _before_ I jump into any contributions
2. [ ] **A lay-of-the-land** explaining the `ARCHITECTURE.md` of the repo - none of the above seem to do this?
3. [ ] **A clear guide to testing the framework on a local project**. I probably came to contribute because I hit a snag in my own project. I should be able to test changes to the framework against _my_ project to see if I fixed everything / implemented my dream feature
4. [ ] **An overview of test suites and linters** that need to pass before my PR is merge-ready
5. [ ] **Some guide to the release process,** especially if there's any pre-release modes or ways to make a test publish (see Astro)
